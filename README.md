# Solar Rooftop Analysis Tool

An AI-powered tool for analyzing rooftop satellite imagery to assess solar installation potential, built for the Solar Industry AI Assistant Internship Assessment.

## Features
- Upload PNG/JPG rooftop images for analysis.
- Uses OpenRouter API for area, orientation, shading, and obstruction detection.
- Fallback to placeholder data (100mÂ², south-facing, 10% shading, 1 chimney).
- Calculates annual energy production (~7,300 kWh/year).
- Estimates cost (~$10,500 after 30% incentive) and payback period (~7 years).
- Provides installation recommendations (e.g., monocrystalline panels, ~50 panels).
